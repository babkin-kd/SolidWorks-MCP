"""Free sketches: a chain of lines, arcs and splines, fully defined.

build_chain checks the segments and works out their geometry: arc centres,
tangent arcs, which segments meet smoothly. plan_chain then picks what fully
defines the sketch, the way sketch_constraints does for polygons: relations
only where the input already holds them exactly (so nothing moves), then one
dimension from the origin per remaining degree of freedom. Which relation or
dimension still removes a degree of freedom follows from the rank of the
constraints' gradients, so one that merely repeats the others (a horizontal
side that a tangent already keeps level) is left out instead of
over-defining the sketch. Both are pure (unit-tested); the session draws.
